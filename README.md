Hello Gennadiy,

I believe i fixed all the errors that you mentioned this time.

Only thing i couldn`t make is double button in the register and login modal are not next to each other. But they are top of each other.

Since i realized that i was texting wrong Gennadiy in the hub, i apologize from him LOL.

Here what i meant to text you:

Hello Gennadiy,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m reaching out because I just resubmitted Project 14 after fixing the functional issues you mentioned (delete item, like button, etc.).

I also wanted to discuss the style-related issues, which are mostly visual. To be honest, I struggle with things like button size or overall appearance (though I did fix the avatar image size). The main reason is that I’ve been working intensively on my final project for over a month now. Since this project addresses a real-world problem and is something personal, it will most likely be the one I showcase on my resume rather than the weather project.

At the moment, I’ve completed the frontend and am working on the backend, which makes it difficult to manage two full-stack projects simultaneously. On top of that, a friend here in Knoxville, TN recently received funding for his tech company, and he’s offered to hire me once I graduate from the bootcamp.
Here is my friend Linkedin :

So, my request is this: if the only remaining issues in Project 14 are purely visual and all functionality works (state, hooks, backend, etc.), I’d like to ask that you pass the project. Of course, I’m more than willing to fix any functional issues if there are still problems in that area.

I’d also be happy to introduce you to my final project, MealMatch, if you’d like to see it.

Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,

Doruk Kocausta

That was before i fixed the problems but now i have only this issue:
Only thing i couldn`t make is double button in the register and login modal are not next to each other. But they are top of each other.

If you can show me how do i do that that would be amazing. So i don`t lost any more time and i can finish my final project and put it online and get my first tech job.

Thank you for understanding.

Best Regards.
