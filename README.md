Hello Gennadiy, i fixed the bugs last night. You sent me like 20 min ago that you can`t sign in or sign up and fixed that too. It is working without error in my computer and i just checked the main branch, everything updated . So i don`t know what the issue is.

check your tripleten hub please, i have been texting you from there.
